SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a process adopt by IT companies to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

We have six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence


1) Feasibility study
---------------------
Feasibility study completely depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical feasibility
	E - Economical feasibility
	L - Legal feasibility
	O - Operational feasibility
	S - Schedule feasibility

All the above information we will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Design Document.

2) Analysis
------------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

In this phase, we will seperate system  requirements and software requirements.	

All the above information they will keep in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement specification.


3) Designing 
------------

We have two types of designing.

1) High Level Designing 
-----------------------
In high level designing we will design main/major modules.

Manager is responsible to perform high level designing.


2) Low Level Designing 
-----------------------
In low level designing we will design child/sub modules.

Team Lead/Project Lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

All the above information they will keep in a document called  PDD/TDD.

PDD stands for Project Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document.


4) Coding 
------------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

Developers are responsible to generate the build and to perform white box testing. 


5) Testing 
----------
In testing phase, testing team or QA team will involved.

Testing team is responsible to perform testing using a software component called STLC.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
------------------------------
Before delivery we will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

It is divided into two types.

i) Alpha Testing 

ii) Beta Testing
