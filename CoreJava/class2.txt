Comments in java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Diagram: class2.1

Comments will not display in output because they will ignore by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single Line Comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple Line Comment 
-------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:
---
	//class declaration 
	class Test
	{
		//main method 
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{

			//variable declaration 
			int i=10;
			
			//output stmt 
			System.out.println(i);	
		}
	}


Project
=======
It is a individual and collaborative work done by the software engineers to achieve perticular goal.

A project is a collection of modules.

We have following list of modules.
ex:
	registration module 
	login module
	payment module 
	report generation module 
	admin module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1) Technical domain 
-------------------
	It describes using which language we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java

2) Functional domain
-------------------
	It describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Banking domain 
		Insaurance domain
		ERP domain 
		and etc. 

Interview Question
-------------------

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK
---
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist of Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and 
other tools needed for java application development.

JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
It is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
