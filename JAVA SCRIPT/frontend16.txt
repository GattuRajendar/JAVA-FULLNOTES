execution.

It is a object oriented programming language.	It is a object based programming language.

It is a complex language.			It is easy language when compare to java.

It is a strongly typed checking language.	It is a loosely typed checking language.


JavaScript
=============
The original name of JavaScript is LiveScript.

LiveScript was developed by Netscape Corporation in late 1990's.

In the year of 1995, Brenden Eich the popular scientist of Netscape Corporation renamed LiveScript to JavaScript.

JavaScript is a loosely typed checking language.

The official name of JavaScript is ECMA script.

ECMA stands for Eureopeon Computer Manufacturer Association.


Advantages of JavaScript
========================
> It is used to develop interactive web pages.

> It is used to perform client side form validation. 

> It is used to add dynamic content to a web page.

> It is used to create responsive(dynamic) design.

> It supports pop-up boxes and dialong boxes.

> It supports objects like Date,Arrays,Strings,RegEx and etc.

> It supports drop-down menu.

> It supports cookies 

and etc.

syntax
-------
	<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
		-
		- //set of statements 
		-
	</script>  

	Here "type" and "language" attribute is optional.

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			document.write("This is Ihub Talent Management");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			document.writeln("This is Ihub Talent Management");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

We can declare markup language inside scripting language.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			document.writeln("<br>");
			document.writeln("This is Ihub Talent Management");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

		document.writeln("<h1 style='color:red'>Welcome to JavaScript class</h1>");
		document.writeln("<br>");
		document.writeln("<h1 style='color:blue'>This is IhubTalent Management</h1>");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

If a document contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript then it is called DHTML (Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language). 

Types of JavaScript
====================
We have two types of javascript.

1) Internal javascript / Embedded javascript  

2) External javascript / Seperate javascript


1) Internal javascript
-----------------------
In internal javascript we will declare HTML code and JavaScript code in .html file.

Advantages:

> There is no confusion of multiple files.

> We can maintain HTML code and java code seperately.

Disadvantages:

> If code is increases then it will increase the complexity.

index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

		document.writeln("Internal javascript");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>


2) External javascript
----------------------
In external javascript we will maintain HTML code in .html file and javascript code in .js file.

A .js file must and should include in .html file by using <script> tag.

Advantages:

> We can maintain HTML code and JavaScript code seperately.

> If code is increases then it will not increase the confusion.

Disadvantages:

> There is a confusion of multiple files.


JavaScript Engine 
=================
JavaScript engine allows to execute javascript code on  browser window.

JavaScript engine converts user understandable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

By default every browser contains javascript engine.

We have following list of javascript engines.

ex:
	Browser 		Javascript engine 
	---------		----------------
	Chrome			V8 engine 
	Mozilla			Spider Monkey
	Safari			JavaScript core
	Edge			Chakra
	and etc.


Output Statements in javascript
================================
We have two types of output statements in javascript.

1) document.writeln()

2) console.log()

1) document.writeln()
------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.

ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
				document.writeln("JavaScript Demo");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

2) console.log()
------------------
It is used to display the output on browser console.

To see the browser console we need to press F12 function key.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>

				console.log("JavaScript Latest Demo");
		
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Comments in JavaScript
======================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

Comments will not display in output.

We have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple line comment 
------------------------
	It is more convenient when compare to single line comment because we can comment a single line 
	as well as multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/
