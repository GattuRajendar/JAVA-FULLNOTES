JDBC
=====
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our applications writing the data in a file or database software.

Files and Database softwares act like a permanent storage device or medium. 

Persistence
===========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Import Terminologies
======================

1) Persistence store
-------------------
	It is a place where we can store the data for a long period of time.
	ex:
		Files
		Database Software 

2) Persistence data
------------------
	A data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
	ex:
		Records
		Tables 

3) Persistence operations 
-------------------------
	Insert,update,delete,select, create and etc are called persistence operations.
	In realtime this operation is also know as CURD operation or CRUD operation or 
	SCUD operation.
	ex:
		C - create 	S - select 
		U - update 	C - create 
		R - read 	U - update 
		D - delete 	D - delete 
	

4) Persistence logic 
---------------------
	A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
	ex:
		JDBC Code 
		Hibernate Code 
		IOStream
		and etc.

5) Persistence technology 
------------------------
	A technology which is used to develop persistence logics is called persistence technology.
	ex:
		JDBC
		Hibernate 
		and etc.





Q) What is JDBC ? 

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.


Note:
-----
					IOStream 
		JavaApp	-------------------------------------------- Files	
				Serialization / Deserialization

				
					JDBC Code 
		JavaApp -------------------------------------------- DB S/W 



Serialization
---------------
The process of taking object data and storing in a file is called serialization.

In serialization object will not store in a file. Object data will store in a file.

In general , serialization means converting object state to file state.

Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
---------------
The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.

In general, deserialization means converting file state to object state.

Diagram: jdbc1.2



Limitations with Files as a persistence store
==============================================

> It will store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple condition is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationship.

> It does not allows us to apply constriants.

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.



Advantages with Database as a persistence store
============================================

> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It supports common query language.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply contraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.


Every JDBC Application is a two-tier application. Where java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a Backend/tier2/layer2.

The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.

The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend. 

Enduser is a non-technical person , he can't prepare and execute SQL query in database software.So He depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver
===========
It acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to converts java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

Diagram: jdbc1.4


ODBC Driver
===========
VBScript, Perl, D2k and etc uses ODBC Driver to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5


ODBC driver developed in C language by taking the support of pointers.

Java does not pointers. 

Hence to overcome this limitation Sun Micro System company introduced JDBC Driver exclusively.


We will get JDBC Softwares from following parties.

1) Sun Micro System ( creator of JDBC Driver)

2) Database Vendor 

3) Third party Vendor 


We will get ODBC softwares from following parties.

1) Xopen company (creator of ODBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor
