Web Application
===============
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web pages / Passive web pages
---------------------------------------
A web page which shows same content is called static web page.
ex:
	Home page 
	aboutus page
	contactus page
	services page
	facebook login page
	and etc.


2) Dynamic web pages / Active web pages
---------------------------------------- 
A web page which shows dynamic content is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page 
	stock market share value page 
	gmail inbox page
	live news page 
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource program 
-----------------------------
A web resource program which is used to generate static web pages is called static web resource program.
ex:
	html program
	CSS program 
	bootstrap program 
	angularjs program 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web resource program 
---------------------------------
A web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages is called dynamic web resource program.
ex:
	servlet program 
	jsp program 
	and etc.

Based on the position and execution these web resources programs are classified into two types.

1) Client side web resource program 
----------------------------------
A web resource program which execute at client side is called client side web resource program.
ex:
	html program 
	css program 
	bootstrap program
	angularjs program
	reactjs program 
	and etc.


2) Server side web resource program 
------------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.
ex:
	servlet program 
	jsp program 
	and etc.


Web application and Web Resource program Execution
==================================================
Java program executes manually.

Web application and web resource program executed at the time when they have requested.

Hence there is no chance to executing web application and web resource program manually.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram
---------------------------
1) Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

2) Web server will trap the request and it will pass the request to appropriate web resource prog.

3) Web resource program executes the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database software if neccessary.

5) Web resource program gives the output to web server.

6) Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.



Web Server
==========
It is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat , Resin and etc.


Responsibilities of web server
------------------------------
1) It takes contineous request from client.

2) It passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

4) It allows client side web resource programs to execute at browser window.

5) It will add middle ware services only to deployed web applications.

6) It gathers the result and send to browser window as dynamic response.

7) It will automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

Web Container
=============
It is a software application or a program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry consider servlet container and jsp container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container so we don't need to arrange it seperately.

 
Tomcat
========
Type			:	Web Server 

Version			:	Tomcat 9.X

Creator			:	James Duncan Davidson

Vendor			:	Apache Software Foundation 

website			:	www.tomcat.apache.org

Port No			:	8080

Servlet container	:	Catalina

JSP container		:	Jasper

Installation 
=============
Double click to Tomcat software --> Yes --> Next --> I Agree --> select full ---> 
Next --> 

server shutdown port : 1 
connector port : 8080 

Adminstrator login 
	username : admin 
  	password : admin  ---> Next --> Next --> Install.



Steps to setup tomcat server to manual mode 
============================================
services --> click to  Apache Tomcat --> click to stop link --> double click to apache tomcat
---> startup type : manual --> apply --> ok.
 
Servlet
=======
Servlet is a dynamic web resource program which enhanced the functionality of web server or proxy server or IDE's server.

or

Servlet is a java based dynamic web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages.

or

Servlet is a single instance multithread java based web resource program which is used to develop web applications.

Servlet API
============
API is a collection of packages.
ex:
	javax.servlet       package
	javax.servlet.http  package
