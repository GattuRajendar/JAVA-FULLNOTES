Limitations With Spring Framework
=================================
In spring framework a programmer is responsible for following things.

1) Adding dependencies or jar files. 

2) Performing configurations in applicationContext.xml file.

3) Arranging physical server like Tomcat.

4) Managing physical database like MySQL. 

To overcome above limitations we need to use Spring Boot.


Spring Boot
============
It is a java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD(Rapid Application Development) features for spring based applications.

It is a standalone, production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short, spring boot is a combination of

ex:
	spring framework       +   Embedded  Server   +   Embedded Database

Spring Boot does not support xml configurations instead it will use annotations.

Note:
-----
	Developer  ---------------> Spring Boot ----------------> Spring Framework 



Advantages with Spring Boot
=============================
1) It is used to develop standalone applications which can be run by using java -jar.

2) It provides optionate starters to simplify the maven development process.

3) It tests the web applications by using HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow.

4) It does not support xml configurations.

5) It provides product ready grade features like metrix, Healthcheck, externalized configurations
   and etc.

6) It provides CLI(Command Line Interface)  Tool to develop and testing spring boot application.
