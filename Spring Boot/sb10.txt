Project Structure
------------------
SpringSecurity
|
|---src/main/java
|	|
	|---com.ihub.www
		|
		|---SpringSecurityApplication.java
	|
	|---com.ihub.www.controller
		|
		|---MyController.java
		|

|---src/main/resources
		|
		|---application.properties 
|
|---src/test/java
|
|---pom.xml 


step1:
-----
	Create a spring boot starter project i.e SpringSecurity.
	ex:
		staters:
			spring web 
			spring security

step2:
-----
	Create a "com.ihub.www.controller" package inside "src/main/java".
	
	

step3:
-----
	Create a MyController.java file inside "com.ihub.www.controller" package.
	
MyController.java
-----------------
package com.ihub.www.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController 
{
	@GetMapping("/home")
	public String home()
	{
		return "I Love Spring Security";
	}
}

step4:
-----
	Configure server port in application.properties.

application.properties
---------------------
server.port= 9090

spring.security.user.name=raja
spring.security.user.password=rani


step5:
------
	Run the spring boot project.
